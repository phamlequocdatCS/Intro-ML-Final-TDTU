Final Project - Introduction to Machine Learning 
By 521K0128 and 521K0143

## Task 1
1. Understanding and comparing various Optimizer methods in training machine learning models.
2. Exploring "Continual Learning and Test Production" in machine learning.

## Task 2: Propose a prediction problem that can be solved using machine learning with the following requirements:
- The number of Features/Attributes includes various types: categorical and numerical types.
- The dataset was not used before in class.

Dataset used: [COVID-19 Dataset by MEIR NIZRI](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirnizri/covid19-dataset)

1. Perform statistical analysis on the data, create graphs to understand the data. Investigate the role of each feature on the problem's objective.

2. Apply basic machine learning models to solve this problem, including Ensemble Learning methods.

3. Use models of Feed Forward Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network (or similar models) to solve this problem.

4. Implement techniques to prevent Overfitting in the models from task (2) and task (3).

5. Once the model training is completed, please analyze the obtained result of one model (you can choose yourself). How to improve the accuracy of these implemented models.
